    "- **DFS**: Stores all nodes along the current search path in memory. This can lead to high memory usage and potential stack overflow in large search spaces.\n",
    "- **ID**: Only stores the current path being explored, using much less memory. It avoids storing all possible paths, which helps reduce memory usage significantly.\n",

    "- **DFS**: Not guaranteed to find a solution if the solution is in a deep branch. May fail in infinite or very deep search spaces.\n",
    "- **ID**: Guaranteed to find the solution if one exists, as it gradually explores all possible depths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Time Complexity**\n",
    "- **DFS**: Time complexity is **O(b^m)**, where `b` is the branching factor and `m` is the maximum depth of the search tree.\n",
    "- **ID**: Time complexity is **O(b^d)**, where `b` is the branching factor and `d` is the depth of the shallowest solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 6. **Disadvantages of Iterative Deepening Over DFS**\n",
